<h2> 18/38 participants chose hot coffee over iced coffee as their preference
    <br> From looking at the data, it doesn't seem that there is a correlation between long the subject has been drinking coffee with how often they drink it
    <br> It also appears that 1/3 of the hot coffee drinkers order lattes and half have some sort of flavoring.
