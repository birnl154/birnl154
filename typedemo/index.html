        The Official Guide to Being a Spooky Scary Skeleton
      </h1>
      <ol class="info">
        <li>
          Be creaky. No one finds uncreaky skeletons scary. If you're not 
          old enough for your bones to creak much yet, do some noises
          with your mouth and no one will be able to tell the difference.
        </li>
        <li>
        Perfect the jaw dropping. It's really scary when skeletons dropping
        their jaws open and they kinda swing a little.
        </li>
        <li>
        Learn your holidays! Skeletons are a big part of holidays like Halloween
        and Dia de los Muertos, know when you're needed!
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't get intimidated by those cheap lawn decorations that people
          put out for Halloween. You're so much better than those pretenders!
        </li>
        <li>
          Accept your immortality. Now that you're a skelton, you're gonna be around a while,
          better get used to it.
        </li>
