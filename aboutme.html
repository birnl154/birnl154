<h1>About Me</h1>
<body>
    <p style="background-image: url('../shadow.tif');">
    <p>Hello, my name is dude Birnbaum and I am a sophomore at Parsons School of Design in New York City. I am a Communication Design major which combines photography with web design. A bit about myself: I have always been a creative and artistic person, and found that passion through the medium of photography from the age of 12, however I have explored many other mediums since. My artistic experiences include: mainly typography, graphic design, and web design, however I also have experience with figure/face/fashion drawing, sewing and fashion design, acrylic and watercolor painting, digital and physical collaging, fashion and portrait photography, construction from self-produced isometric and orthographic drawings, research and writing about design and fashion topics, poetry, and fashion makeup and styling. I will include all of these projects to showcase the range of my abilities. Though I am just starting my journey as an artist, I am extremely hard-working and passionate toward my work and determined to only give the best results that I am capable of. thank you for your consideration of my work.
    </p>
