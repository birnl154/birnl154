    <p>the short story that i chose to base my website off of is "Library of Babel." in this story, there is a fictional library that contains every possible combination of characters possible.
        in effect, only a very few of the books are actually legible. for all of time, librarians have scoured the books on the shelevs to find pieces that are legible and may give them answers to
        their questions. my site acts as a scroll that could be found on the shelves of the library and the user acts as one of the librraians, scrolling through and deciphering the text.
    i use the hover effect to simulate the thin line between legible and illegible that exists in the library. this is still a work in progress as i am trying to find more ways in which the user 
    can interact with the website and create their own journey rather than just follow the one that i have given them.
