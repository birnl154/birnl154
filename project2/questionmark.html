        <h2>aim of this project</h2>
        <h3>what i did with this project was collect people's' coffee orders as well as how they take it, how long they have been drinking coffee, and how often they drink coffee.
            <br> the data collection process involved asking strangers in cafes, peers in class, and allowing people to submit data themselves on my instagram. 
            <br> in addition to the questions themselves, i asked for a picture of their coffees and drew illustrations to go with each, which really reaches to the core of the project. 
            <br>i chose this topic because i find it fascinating how so many people drink coffee, and yet what that looks—and tastes—like for each person is often vastly different. it should be noted that 
            because of my limited time to gather data for this project, the age range of subjects was smaller than i originally wanted, and i think age actually plays a 
            huge factor in coffee habits, so definitely consider this project as a look at coffee habits of those under age 30. as you explore the website, simply click on each page to learn about that specific 
            coffee order and the subject who ordered it. i also added facts that i concluded from the gathered data for additonal observation. enjoy.
