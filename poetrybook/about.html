        This website is an iteration from a book I made called "Famous Poems by Shakespearean AI." 
        The aim of this project  was to experiment with the current language
         imitations of AI by applying them to well-known pieces
        for comparison. I began by asking Chat GPT
        to take on the voice of Shakespeare and subsequently fed it poems that I wanted it to transform into
         Shakespearean language. This book was centered around reading and learning, which is why I 
         wanted to make this website for writing and experimenting. This website is a space to
         create poems, inspired by the correlating book. I also created a separate Shakespearean word page
         to give users a chance to embody the role that AI took on in the book: working within the confines
         of certain vocabulary to create poetry that resembles Shakespeare. -Lydia Birnbaum
