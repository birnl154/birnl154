                <p>The Waddesdon Bequest was left to the British Museum in 1898 by Baron Ferdinand Rothschild's will. Taken from his New Smoking Room at Waddesdon Manor, it consists of almost 300 pieces, including jewellery, plate, enamel, carvings, glass and maiolica. 
                    Earlier than most objects is the Holy Thorn Reliquary, probably created in the 1390s in Paris for John, Duke of Berry. 
                    The wide-ranging collection is in the tradition of a treasure house, such as those owned by the Renaissance princes of Europe. Most of the objects are from late Renaissance Europe; there are several important medieval pieces, and outliers from classical antiquity and medieval Syria. 
                    Rothschild selected intricate, superbly executed, highly decorated and rather ostentatious works of the Late Gothic, Renaissance and Mannerist periods for this collection.
                     Few of the objects relied on the Baroque sculptural movement for their effect, though several come from periods and places where many Baroque pieces were being made. (Full article...)</p>

             There are nineteen defunct and relocated National Hockey League (NHL) 
             teams. The NHL Board of Governors review and approve the relocation of any member club. Each team appoints an individual or individuals to represent their team on the Board of Governors. A majority vote is needed for relocation of a club. The first team to relocate was the Quebec Athletics, who relocated to Hamilton, Ontario, to become the Hamilton Tigers. The NHL president at the time, Frank Calder, stripped the franchise from owner Mike Quinn and sold it to a Hamilton-based company. Three franchises became defunct due to the Great Depression: the Philadelphia Quakers, the St. Louis Eagles, and the Montreal Maroons. During their time in the NHL, the defunct Ottawa Senators and Maroons both won the Stanley Cup championship multiple times, with four and two titles respectively. (Full list...)</p>

       <p> The Hayden Bridge is a wrought-iron truss bridge that was manufactured by the
        Phoenixville Bridge Works in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania.
         It was built in 1882 and was initially located near Corinne, Utah, crossing the Bear River as part of the first transcontinental railroad. 
         In 1901, the bridge was moved more than 1,000 miles (1,600 km) and reassembled at its present location, crossing the 
         McKenzie River in Springfield, Oregon, where it served as part of the Marcola line for the distribution of lumber. 
         It later closed down due to the closure of the area's lumbermills, 
         until it was converted into a pedestrian bridge in 2019. It is the oldest intact bridge in the state of Oregon. This photograph of the Hayden Bridge was taken as part of a 
         1990 Historic American Engineering Record survey.</p>
